    "Like a list of days of the week or months in a year or even Pokemons in a team. \n",

    "But lets take a step back and try to understand \n",
    "Before going more in depth on what linked lists are and how you can use them, you should first learn how they are structured. Each element of a linked list is called a node, and every node has two different fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Practical Applications__\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists serve a variety of purposes in the real world. They can be used to implement (spoiler alert!) queues or stacks as well as graphs. Theyâ€™re also useful for much more complex tasks, such as lifecycle management for an operating system application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to think about a sequence of operations that need to be executed in line. \n",
